## Proposed: Definition of Done

**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Complexity:** Medium

### Concept

Clear criteria for when a task/feature/system is truly complete, reducing ambiguity and interruptions.

### Challenge

Need to balance:
- Human-in-the-loop verification (for important features)
- Autonomous completion (for routine tasks)
- Interruption minimization (maintaining flow)

### Potential Levels

**Level 1: Autonomous Complete**
- Simple implementations following clear specs
- No human verification needed
- Examples: Data schema creation, simple utility functions, documentation updates

**Level 2: Self-Check Complete**
- IC_Agent tests against criteria
- Reports results
- Human verifies via Devlog review (asynchronous)
- Examples: Standard feature implementations, refactors

**Level 3: Human Verification Required**
- Core gameplay mechanics
- New system architectures
- User-facing changes
- Examples: Combat system, level progression, UI changes

### Example Definition

```markdown
## Definition of Done

### For Tasks (IC_Agent)
A task is complete when:
- [ ] All implementation steps followed
- [ ] Code follows Engineering Standards
- [ ] Data separated from logic
- [ ] Self-tested against acceptance criteria
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Devlog.md updated with test results

### For Features (PM_Agent/IC_Agent)
A feature is complete when:
- [ ] All tasks in feature complete
- [ ] Integration tested
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Human verification received (if Level 3)

### For Systems (PM_Agent)
A system is complete when:
- [ ] All features implemented
- [ ] System architecture documented
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Ready for dependent systems
```

### Questions to Resolve

1. **When to interrupt for verification?**
   - End of each task? (Too much)
   - End of feature? (Better)
   - End of session? (Async review)

2. **How to handle feedback loops?**
   - IC_Agent creates → Human reviews → IC_Agent fixes
   - PM_Agent proposes → Human approves → IC_Agent implements

3. **What about iterative features?**
   - MVP complete vs Full complete
   - When is "good enough" actually good enough?

### Implementation When Ready

1. Define the three levels clearly
2. Add to Engineering Standards
3. Reference in AgentRoles.md
4. Test with real features
5. Adjust based on interruption frequency
6. Consider tooling (automated checks, test runners)

---

## Proposed: Automated Testing Integration

**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Priority:** Low  
**Complexity:** High

### Concept

Integrate automated testing into the Definition of Done, potentially using tools like Jest or Playwright.

### Challenges
- Setup overhead
- Maintenance burden for solo dev
- May not fit rapid iteration style
- Tooling dependencies

### Potential Benefits
- Catch regressions automatically
- Reduce manual testing burden
- Enable confident refactoring
- Clear pass/fail criteria

### Decision
Defer until project maturity increases and manual testing becomes bottleneck.

## Proposed: Visual Testing Tools

**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Priority:** Low  
**Complexity:** Medium

### Concept

Build lightweight visual testing tools (beyond browser-based):
- Component playground
- API response viewer
- State visualization tool
- Performance profiler

### From Engineering Standards
These are mentioned but not mandated. Could be valuable for:
- Rapid iteration on application feel
- Non-programmer contribution
- Debugging complex features

### Implementation Approach
- Build as separate HTML pages
- Load application data files
- Visualize without full application context
- Create when specific pain point emerges

---

## Proposed: Agent Skill Specialization

**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Priority:** Low  
**Complexity:** Medium

### Concept

Split IC_Agent into specialized roles as project scales:
- IC_Developer (code implementation)
- IC_ContentCreator (data files, levels, items)
- IC_Documenter (documentation maintenance)
- IC_Tester (testing focus)

### Current State
Single generalized IC_Agent works fine for solo dev scale.

### Trigger for Specialization
- Multiple parallel work streams
- Clear efficiency gains from specialization
- Different model tiers excel at different tasks
- Token costs make specialization worthwhile

### Implementation When Ready
1. Split AgentRoles.md into sub-roles
2. Define clear boundaries
3. Create role-specific prompts
4. Test with sample work
5. Measure efficiency gains

## Proposed: Fractal Documentation Pattern

**Status:** IDEA
**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** High

### Concept

Apply the "fractal growth" philosophy to documentation itself:

**Level 1: Overview** (ContextChain)
- What's happening now
- Quick orientation

**Level 2: Plans** (ProjectPlan)
- What we're building
- Architecture and systems

**Level 3: Logs** (Devlog)
- What we built
- How it went

**Level 4: Code** (Inline documentation)
- How it works
- Implementation details

Each level should reference up/down the chain but not duplicate.

### Questions
- Is this already what we have?
- How to enforce the pattern?
- What's gained vs added complexity?

### Status
Needs more real-world use to determine if formalization helps or hinders.

---

## Rejected Ideas

### [REJECTED - 2025-10-31] Separate Product Owner Role

**Reason:** Solo dev makes product decisions directly. AI assists with implementation, not product vision.

**Context:** Considered for maintaining product consistency, but adds unnecessary abstraction when human is the product authority.

---

## Questions for Future Resolution

### Process Questions
1. What's the right cadence for ContextChain updates?
2. Should Handoff.md be a single file or per-session files?
3. When should ProjectPlan.md be restructured vs appended?
4. How to handle divergence between plan and implementation?

### Tooling Questions
1. Should we use a task tracking system (Trello, Linear, etc.)?
2. Would Git commit hooks help with documentation?
3. Could we automate Devlog.md generation from commits?
4. Should we version control the agent docs themselves?

### Scope Questions
1. At what project size does this process break down?
2. When should multiple concurrent PM_Agent sessions be used?
3. How to handle emergency bug fixes vs planned work?
4. How does this scale for enterprise projects with multiple developers?
