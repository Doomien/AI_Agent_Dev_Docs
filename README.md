# AI Agent Dev Docs

Documentation system for AI-assisted solo software development.

## Start Here

1. Read the v01 product definition: [`v01/PRODUCT_V1.md`](v01/PRODUCT_V1.md)
2. Read the v01 execution plan: [`v01/BACKLOG_2_WEEKS.md`](v01/BACKLOG_2_WEEKS.md)
3. Use the current lightweight framework in [`v02/`](v02)
4. Review generic technical guidance in [`technical-suggestions/`](technical-suggestions)
5. Browse research and non-operational docs in [`references/`](references)

## Docs Map

### v01 (verbose planning baseline)

Use `v01` when you need full context, rationale, and explicit success criteria.

- Product definition: [`v01/PRODUCT_V1.md`](v01/PRODUCT_V1.md)
- Initial execution backlog: [`v01/BACKLOG_2_WEEKS.md`](v01/BACKLOG_2_WEEKS.md)

### v02 (operational day-to-day workflow)

Use `v02` during active implementation cycles with one or more agents.

- Framework overview: [`v02/README.md`](v02/README.md)
- Workflow rules: [`v02/WORKFLOW.md`](v02/WORKFLOW.md)
- Active context: [`v02/CONTEXT.md`](v02/CONTEXT.md)
- Progress and task status: [`v02/PROGRESS.md`](v02/PROGRESS.md)
- Planning to execution handoff template: [`v02/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`](v02/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md)
- v01 to v02 migration notes: [`v02/MIGRATION_NOTES.md`](v02/MIGRATION_NOTES.md)

### references (research and non-operational material)

Use `references` for analysis, recommendations, and background reading.

- Reference index: [`references/README.md`](references/README.md)

### technical-suggestions (reusable engineering guidance)

Use `technical-suggestions` for baseline technical decision support that can be reused across projects.

- Tech stack guidance: [`technical-suggestions/tech-stack-recommendations.md`](technical-suggestions/tech-stack-recommendations.md)
- Phaser starter conventions: [`technical-suggestions/phaser-project-template.md`](technical-suggestions/phaser-project-template.md)

## What This Repository Provides

- A docs operating system for running PM/IC-style agent sessions
- Standard templates for plan, handoff, context continuity, and engineering standards
- Operational guidance for contribution and workflow improvements

## Who This Is For

- Solo developers using AI agents for day-to-day implementation
- Teams validating agent-assisted workflows before broader adoption

## Current Scope (v1)

v1 focuses on one outcome: predictable session execution with reliable handoffs.

In scope:
- Fast onboarding into a working docs workflow
- Clear role boundaries between planning and implementation sessions
- Canonical, non-conflicting contribution workflow
- A worked example docs set

Out of scope:
- Full project management platform features
- Multi-team governance and enterprise policy layers
- Advanced automation infrastructure

## Long-Term Direction

- Build generic technical suggestion docs for decisions like tech stack selection.
- Evolve a shared baseline into customized documentation sets for different project types.
- Focus early customization on internal tools for small, casual video game prototyping teams.
- Improve systems engineering and architecture coherence to increase interoperability.
- Reduce technical troubleshooting overhead so the team can spend more time building game experiences.
